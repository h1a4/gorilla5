About
"Egg" or "Egg Mode" is an Internet and LGBTQ+ slang used to describe transgender individuals who do not realize they are a transgender person yet, or are in denial about being a transgender individual. The term is best compared to "the closet," a term used when referring to a state of secrecy and insecurity about one's homosexuality, with "hatching" having a similar meaning as "coming out."

Origin
On August 23rd, 2016, the term "Egg mode" was defined by Urban Dictionary user bitplane7 as "Someone who is trans but doesn't know it yet. Someone who is still an embryo of the trans person they will eventually hatch into."[2] The definition gained 106 upvotes and four downvotes in three years. On August 9th 2017, Urban Dictionary user happycookie defined "egg" as "Transgender person who hasn't come out yet. A chick or a c--k on the inside." the definition has received 329 upvoted and 89 downvotes in two years. It has since become the top definition for this term. [3]

Precursor
Prior to becoming popular in the transgender community, "Egg Mode" was infrequently used to describe pets, most commonly cats sitting with their legs completely hidden under their bodies, giving them an egg shape (shown below).
