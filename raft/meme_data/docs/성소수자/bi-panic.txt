About
Bi Panic, also known as Bisexual Panic, is a humorous slang term used to describe one's confusion or distress at being attracted to different genders at the same time. The phrase is often used in internet stan communities and it is also a prominent image caption in LGBTQ+ and fandom communities. While the origins of the expression can be traced back to 2015, it didn't come to be widely used online until 2021 when the phrase became a prevalent subject of fan art and memes on Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr.
